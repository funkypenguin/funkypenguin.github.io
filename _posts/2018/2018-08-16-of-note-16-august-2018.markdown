* [Setting MTU of docker_gwbridge in swarm mode](https://forums.docker.com/t/setting-container-mtu-in-swarm-mode/44976)
&#8594; Helpful tip re globally changing MTU on docker_gwbridge - useful if you're running your swarm on OpenStack with VXLAN, since your default MTU is 1450, but Docker sets docker_gwbridge MTU to 1500, so stuff breaks ;)

* [Solved - milter-greylist dies when IPv6 sendmail connection](https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/milter-greylist-dies-when-ipv6-sendmail-connection.60468/)
&#8594; Does your milter-greylist crash with "cmd read returned 0, expecting 5"? Do you have IPv6 and GeoIP enabled? You need a geoipv6db directive in your config file! :)
