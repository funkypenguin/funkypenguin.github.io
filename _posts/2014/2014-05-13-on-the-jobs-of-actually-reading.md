Against the author's wishes, I'm sharing the article titled "[Actually Reading][1]", a comment on the fact that we (I'm guilty of this) often appreciate an article for it social "sharability" rather than the value it adds to us.

I'm trying to combat this in my own reading by (like in this post) at least adding semi-intelligent comment to the process of sharing something I enjoyed and would recommend to friends.
