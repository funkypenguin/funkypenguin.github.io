An excerpt from the excellent [Farnam Street Blog][1] (below). I'm trying to be more intentional about how I spend my time, and be more "present in the moment". I especially liked the following, re the difference that it makes to slow down, not considering all hours to be equal:

> The illusion of speed is the belief that it saves time. It looks simple at first sight: finish something in two hours instead of three, gain an hour. It’s an abstract calculation, though, done as if each hour of the day were like an hour on the clock, absolutely equal. But haste and speed accelerate time, which passes more quickly, and two hours of hurry shorten a day. Every minute is torn apart by being segmented, stuffed to bursting. You can pile a mountain of things into an hour.
