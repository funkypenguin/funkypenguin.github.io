Jeremy Vandehey points out in "[This is your brain on mobile][1]" that buying a watch can reduce the amount of time you spend distracted on your smartphone, since you won't be whipping it out to check the time, only to repeat a few min later because you've forgotten. (this totally happens to me!) I'm holding out for the [rumored iWatch][2] before making any purchasing decisions though.
