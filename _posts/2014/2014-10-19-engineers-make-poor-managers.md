**Update**: after a back-and-forth with Lindsay, this post should more accurately be titled "Good engineer != good manager"

In [It's not a promotion - it's a career change][1], [Lindsay Holmwood][2] explains why so many engineers "promoted" to management do such a poor job..

> The truth of the matter is this: you are woefully unprepared for a career in management, and you are unaware of how badly unprepared you are.

Among the reasons for the above are how devalued the "soft" skills are, among the tech industry, and how often we underestimate how much we don't know, while overestimating our existing competencies (the Dunning-Kruger effect).

[Read the whole article][1] for a deep analysis, plus some tips for making the aforementioned "career change"..
