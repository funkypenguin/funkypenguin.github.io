This video (below) complains that we're getting ever worse at focusing our attention

<div class="flex-video">

</div>

Personally, I find it much harder to focus on video than I do on reading. My preferred means of learning is reading, followed by listening, followed by video. I think it's because reading permits you to focus your mind entirely on the content, rather than on the delivery.
