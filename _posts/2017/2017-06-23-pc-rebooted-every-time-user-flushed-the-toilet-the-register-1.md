A funny illustration that familiarity with a broad set of disciplines improves overall results:

Quoted from [PC rebooted every time user flushed the toilet â€¢ The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/06/23/on_call/):
> The user then suggested Gary observe the PC as they walked to the bathroom. Gary heard the unmistakable gurgling that resulted and watched as the PC did indeed reset itself about two seconds later.
