The following are interesting links I've stumbled across recently:

:bookmark: [Not that scary or that hard: Two decades of VLANS • The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/06/30/vlans_at_20/)
&#8594; This should be required reading for any IT engineer.

:bookmark: [Shock: NASA denies secret child sex slave cannibal colony on Mars • The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/06/30/nasa_denies_child_colony_on_mars/)
&#8594; Seriously. Some of the inhabitants of _this_ planet are a galactic embarrassment.

:bookmark: [Quick tip on writing git commit messages](https://mastodon.herebedragons.io/users/jan/updates/801)
&#8594; A helpful way to structure your commit messages to keep them consistent and useful
