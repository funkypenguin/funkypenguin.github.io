:bookmark: [The SR-71 speed check story - SR71](https://www.reddit.com/r/SR71/comments/2dpmw7/the_sr71_speed_check_story/)

:bookmark: [How to Obfuscate - Issue 49: The Absurd - Nautilus](http://nautil.us/issue/49/the-absurd/how-to-obfuscate)

:bookmark: [The case of the 500-mile email](https://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail.html)
&#8594; A classic case
