This should have been better thought through. Why would you want users to use their personal FB profile for ANY administrative tasks? Thats just bound to end badly.

Quoted from [Revealed: Facebook exposed identities of moderators to suspected terrorists ](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/16/facebook-moderators-identity-exposed-terrorist-groups):
> The moderator said that when he started, he was given just two weeks training and was required to use his personal Facebook account to log into the social media giant’s moderation system.

“They should have let us use fake profiles,” he said, adding: “They never warned us that something like this could happen.”
