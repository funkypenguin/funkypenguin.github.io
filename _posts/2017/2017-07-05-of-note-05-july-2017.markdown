:bookmark: [MySQL skip duplicate replication errors - MDLog:/sysadmin](http://www.ducea.com/2008/02/13/mysql-skip-duplicate-replication-errors/)
&#8594; This came in handy today, to eliminate the pain caused by an application updating both the master _and_ the replicated slave database. Fixing these is normally a huge PITA involving table-level locking on the production database. No longer!
