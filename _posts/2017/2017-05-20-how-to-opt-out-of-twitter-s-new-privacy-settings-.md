I just toggled the "opt-out-of-everything-yes-I'm-sure" button. Last thing I want is all my web activity tracked by Twitter for "better personalized ads"!

> Twitter has [stated](https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2017/05/meanwhile-at-twitter/) that these granular settings are intended to replace Twitterâ€™s reliance on [Do Not Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track). However, replacing a standard cross-platform choice with new, complex options buried in the settings is not a fair trade.
