How machine-learning generated text can fool humans reading on “autopilot” (vs deep reading and comprehension)..

Quoted from [Humans Who Are Not Concentrating Are Not General Intelligences ](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2019/02/25/humans-who-are-not-concentrating-are-not-general-intelligences/):

> The point is, _if you skim text, you miss obvious absurdities_.  The point is _OpenAI HAS achieved the ability to pass the Turing test against humans on autopilot_.
