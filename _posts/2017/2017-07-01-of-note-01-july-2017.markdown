The following are interesting links I've stumbled across recently:

:bookmark: [Not-da-Mama. In Jurassic park.](https://mobile.twitter.com/thisjenlewis/status/879910932859768833)
&#8594; Jurassic Park, with TV's dinosaurs. I loved that show :)

:bookmark: [The Wall Street Journalâ€™s Mini-Documentary on the iPhone](https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-wall-street-journals-mini-documentary-on-the-creation-of-the-iphone/)
&#8594; Bound to be an interesting watch.

:bookmark: [Migrating your Jekyll site to Netlify | Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/05/11/migrating-your-jekyll-site-to-netlify/)
&#8594; I'm always looking for ways to improve my blogging workflow. This is worth a look at.
