A gratifying result on a2-year study re the benefits of remote work. Mirrors my own experience. I deal with the “isolation problem” by doing video calls with colleagues where possible (vs phone calls).

Quoted from [A 2-Year Stanford Study Shows the Astonishing Productivity Boost of Working From Home ](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html):

> Instead, the robust, nearly two-year study showed an astounding productivity boost among the telecommuters equivalent to a full day's work. Turns out work-from-home employees work a true full-shift (or more) versus being late to the office or leaving early multiple times a week and found it less distracting and easier to concentrate at home.
