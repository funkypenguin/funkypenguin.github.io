I just finished reviewing my IFTTT ~~recipies~~ applets since the introduction of the "[new IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/blog/2016/11/the-new-ifttt-is-here)". I discovered that it's now a little more involved to create and share applets than the previous "recipe" metaphor.

I setup archival of [liked youtube videos](https://ifttt.com/applets/59236845d-save-liked-youtube-videos-to-day-one), twitter [tweets](https://ifttt.com/applets/dYcpqsKs-save-your-tweets-to-day-one) / [favorites](https://ifttt.com/applets/vYTq6PqV-save-liked-tweets-to-day-one) and [spotify tracks](https://ifttt.com/applets/59236947d-add-new-saved-tracks-to-journal-entry) using the [DayOne-supplied applets](https://ifttt.com/day_one), but didn't find a pre-prepared applet to sent RSS feeds to a journal.

I wanted to archive my blog posts to my [DayOne](https://ifttt.com/day_one) journal, so I created [an applet](https://ifttt.com/applets/tcVdtBbR-rss-feed-to-dayone) which creates a new journal entry for every new entry on an RSS feed. If this is useful to you, you can find the applet [here](https://ifttt.com/applets/tcVdtBbR-rss-feed-to-dayone).
