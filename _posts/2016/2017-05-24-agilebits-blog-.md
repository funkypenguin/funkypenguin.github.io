Sadly, a very sensible precaution. I continue to recommend 1Password as a must-have tool for modern tech life.

Quoted from [AgileBits Blog ](https://blog.agilebits.com/2017/05/18/introducing-travel-mode-protect-your-data-when-crossing-borders/):
> Travel Mode is a new feature we’re making available to **everyone with a 1Password membership**. It protects your 1Password data from unwarranted searches when you travel. When you turn on Travel Mode, every vault will be removed from your devices except for the ones marked “safe for travel.” All it takes is a single click to travel with confidence.
