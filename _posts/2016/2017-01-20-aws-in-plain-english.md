In [AWS in Plain English](https://www.expeditedssl.com/aws-in-plain-english), I read

> Hey, have you heard of the new AWS services: ContainerCache, ElastiCast and QR72? Of course not, I just made those up. But with 50 plus opaquely named services, we decided that enough was enough and that some plain english descriptions were needed.

What follows is a detailed list of services, sorted by the likelihood that you'll use them.

Hopefully this will help AWS beginners (like myself) get up to speed faster!
