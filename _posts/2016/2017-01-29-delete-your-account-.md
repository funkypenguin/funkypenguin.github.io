In [Delete your account ](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/28/delete-your-account/?ncid=rss), I read:

> In the end all we do on social media is akin to a fart in a crowded room â€“ sure to annoy someone nearby but dissipated by the time it reaches the edges.

Blunt but accurate. One of the deceptions of social media is how it tries to convince us that we can effect any significant change with a "retweet" or a "like"!
