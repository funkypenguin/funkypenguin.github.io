In [Five Things You Notice When You Quit the News](http://www.raptitude.com/2016/12/five-things-you-notice-when-you-quit-the-news/), I read:


> Every minute spent watching news is a minute you are unavailable for learning about the world in other ways. Americans probably watch a hundred million hours of news coverage every day. That’s a lot of unread books, for one thing.
>
> Read three books on a topic and you know more about it than 99% of the world. Watch news all day for years and you have a distant, water-cooler-level awareness of thousands of stories, at least for the few weeks each is popular.

I like this rationale. It's a bit like the social media experience, I think. You can spend an hour grazing the shallow social media updates of 100 "friends" and gain no significant connection to them, or you can spend an hour engaging a friend directly and build/maintain a deep, personal connection.
