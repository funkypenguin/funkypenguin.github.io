In preparing an author bio (harder than it sounds!) for a PHPList book I've been authoring, I dug up this old copy of a <a title="JAJC Manual" href="http://jajc.jrudevels.org/" target="_blank">JAJC</a> (a win32 jabber client) manual I wrote in 2003, using Docbook XML.

It's probably no longer valid, but here it is anyway, for posterity :) [JAJC Manual][1]. Sadly, the docbook XML source is lost in time - it would have been fun to compare it to the sexiness that is [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [leanpub](http://www.leanpub.com) today.
