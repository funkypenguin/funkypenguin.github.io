I spent the better part of an hour wondering why my postfix main.cf config changes didn't apply on a OSX Mountain Lion server. Turns out that because "OSX Server" no longer exists (itâ€™s just Server.app now), the postfix files specific to the Mail component of the server now live at:

    /Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix/

Which is confusing, since the originals still exist at /etc/postfix

Anyway, files edited, service restarted, config applied!
