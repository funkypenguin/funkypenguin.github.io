excerpt: What is this silly coin and why are you mining it?
---
Some weeks ago I stumbled across [TurtleCoin](https://turtlecoin.lol), while researching new cryptocurrencies to mine, on [cryptunit.com](https://cryptunit.com).

I rolled my eyes at the stupidity of the cryptogeeks, and moved on to mine some RavenCoin, which [r/gpumining](https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/) had told me was the new hotness.

As I returned to cryptounit over the next few days, I kept seeing TurtleCoin among the top 3-5 most profitable coins, and my curiosity got the better of me. I researched it, and found that it's a "tech-first" cryptocurrency forked from ByteCoin, and so based on cryptonote, which means it's a distant cousin of [Monero](https://getmonero.org/), reigning king of the privacy coins. In every description however, the **community** was highlighted as the distinguishing feature of TurtleCoin.

**Aside**: In my gamer days in South Africa, I was part of a "gaming clan" called [CHKNHD](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chknhd) (_'Chicken Head', or "running around like headless chickens"_), an irreverant bunch of gamers who (_unlike most "clans"_) were more interested in having fun (_and drinking stroh rum, a process they termed "**devolution**"_) than succeeding at any sort of competitive gaming. TurtleCoin seems to embody that same spirit - focusing on building a dev community rather than hyping yet-another cryptocurrency.

I soon discovered that there were no NZ (or AU) mining pools. So I mined elsewhere. But I'd been toying with the idea of running a mining pool for some time, and so this seemed like a good opportunity to (a) write a [Geek's Cookbook recipe re running a mining pool](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/recipies/turtle-pool/), and (b) learn more about blockchain tech by getting involved on the "ground floor".

So, I started with a [simple PR](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtle-pool/pull/11) to correct a typo in the README for "turtle-pool", a fork of forknote-pool. Wanting to test my pool in a "dev environment", I started working on a Docker container to run a testnet swarm.

I ended up creating the first redundant-daemon, dockerized TurtleCoin mining pool, [trtl.heigh-ho.funkypenguin.co.nz/](https://trtl.heigh-ho.funkypenguin.co.nz/)
