Hi, I'm [David](/contact). When I was a kid, I wanted to to grow up to be an inventor. In many ways I have. I've spent 20+ years working with IT, and I'm specifically interested in networking, systems, open-source, and technical documentation. My current role is __Senior Infrastructure Architect_ at [Prophecy Networks](http://www.prophecy.net.nz) in New Zealand.

## Why "Funky Penguin"?

My first "real" job, out of high-school, was working the IT helpdesk in a typical pre-2000 organization in South Africa. I enjoyed experimenting with Linux, and cut my teeth by replacing the organization's Exchange 5.5 mail platform with a 15-site [qmail-ldap](http://www.nrg4u.com/) cluster, with [amavis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amavis) virus-scanning.

One of our suppliers asked me to quote to do the same for their organization. With nothing to loose, and half-expecting to be turned down, I quoted a generous fee, and chose a cheeky company name. The supplier immediately accepted my quote, and the name (__Funky Penguin__) stuck.

## Technical Documentation

During the same "real" job above, I wanted to deploy [jabberd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberd14), for internal instant messaging within the organization, and as a means to control the sprawl of ad-hoc instant-messaging among staff, using ICQ, MSN, and Yahoo Messenger.

To get management approval to deploy, I wrote a logger (with web UI) for jabber conversations ([Bandersnatch](/project/bandersnatch/)), and a 75-page user manual (in [Docbook XML](http://www.docbook.org/) for a spunky Russian WinXP jabber client, [JAJC](http://jajc.jrudevels.org/).

Due to my contributions to [phpList](http://www.phplist.com), I was approached in 2011 by [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com), to [write a book](/book/phplist-2-email-campaign-manager) about using PHPList.
